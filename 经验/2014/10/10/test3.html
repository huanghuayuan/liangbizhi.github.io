		<p>Here's some general guidelines.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Work with A Better Coder</div>
		<p>The fastest way is to learn from a much better coder. Ask questions about design decisions and the libraries that she/he uses.</p>




		<div class="sub-title">Copy Good Codes</div>
		<p>Yes, when you see a piece of good code that does something better than how you could have designed it, use <i>Ctrl-C</i> and <i>Ctrl-V</i>. Copy it and modify it and learn why it's better (usually because it's simpler). Just remember to also give credit to the original author.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Use Popular Libraries</div>
		<p>Libraries will save your time because they prevent you from reinventing the wheel. Popular libraries are usually maintained by a community of experienced coders. Using the library will also likely enforce a better programming style. Just like how you would study vocabulary words to improve your language skills, learning new libraries improves your programming vocabulary. If you're ambitious, you can even look in the source code and see how the logic is organized.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Care About Style</div>
		<p>In programming, form is function. For example, this is literally true in Python, where indentation indicates scope. But even for languages that are space agnostic, a clear style prevents errors. Good style also lends itself to documentation or, even better, is automatic documentation.</p>
		<p>If you read a piece of code that is easy to understand, emulate its style and organization. And also read peoples' blogs about programming style.</p>
		<p>Some basic style habits that I practice are,</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Using long and descriptive function and variable names. Nowadays, your code will never burden a computer's memory just because of the extra bytes in a long variable name. Plus, if you see a compiled language, the complier will replace all the names anyways. If your're lazy about typing long names, set up tab autocomplete.</li>
			<li>Using action verbs for your function names. Instead of "getCorrectedName()", I use "rename()". In this case, "rename" is a more precise verb than "get" and it simplifies the function name.</li>
			<li>Writing small functions that only do one task. If a function does more than one thing, I break it down into subfunctions that do only one thing each. This makes the code more modular and easier to debug. This also makes function names self-documenting.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="sub-title">Develop Iteratively</div>
		<p>The most common reason that people give up on programming is that they don't enjoy the results of their work.</p>
		<p>As you learn about more frameworks and libraries, it becomes tempting to write the whole project and then click run. It probably won't work. It's better to plan out the structure and then write tiny parts of the code. Test each part, experience the thrill of watching it work and then drop it into your overall project.</p>
		<p>If you're an experienced programmer, create classes and objects, even for your small scripts. Even if you think, "Oh, this will be a script for something small", if it works well, chances are you'll want to expand it or use it for something else. Instead of duplicating code or writing complex <i>if-else</i> blocks, it feels amazing to just inherit from the original class, make some small changes and have a newly customized application.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Use StackOverflow</div>
		<p>Almost every common task and bug is solved on StackOverflow. Plus, the solutions are elegant and the answers give great explainations.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Write for Your Future Self</div>
		<p>Imagine your future self either has amnesia or grows stupider (both usually feel true). It's always a satisfying feeling to look over your old code and be greeted by user-friendly documentation.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Use Version Control</div>
		<p>Github hosts Git repositories (projects), Bitbucket hosts Git and Mercurial. If you aren't comfortable with command line programming, then I recommend using SourceTree and Bitbucket.</p>
		<div class="sub-title">Share Your Code</div>
		<p>Let other people use it, give you suggestions and ask for improvements. You're also more motivated to improve programs that other people are using.</p>
